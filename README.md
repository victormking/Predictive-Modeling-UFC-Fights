Predictive-Modeling-UFC-Fights

## Project Overview

This project uses comprehensive data from the UFC to predict fight outcomes and evaluate various influencing factors. The dataset includes statistics such as strikes landed, takedowns, fight venue, and much more. By building predictive models and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project aims to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that could help in forecasting the outcomes of future UFC matches.

## Objectives


Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict the outcomes of UFC fights.

Exploratory Analysis: Identify key statistics and patterns that influence fight outcomes.

Statistical Insights: Understand how different factors like venue, strikes, and takedowns impact the fight results.

## Data Sources

Data Contains comprehensive statistics for UFC fights, with each row representing a specific match. Statistics include strikes landed, takedowns, fighter attributes, and more.

## Methodology

## Data Preparation:

Cleaned and standardized the data to ensure consistent statistical analysis.

Engineered new features from existing columns to enhance model predictability.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized key statistics and identified patterns using ggplot2.

Analyzed distribution patterns of strikes, takedowns, and other metrics.

## Predictive Modeling:

Built predictive models using logistic regression to classify fight winners.

Evaluated the accuracy and robustness of the models via cross-validation.

## Statistical Analysis:

Identified significant features impacting fight outcomes through statistical tests.

Measured and interpreted correlations between different fight statistics.

## Key Findings

Striking Advantage: Fights where one fighter had a significantly higher number of strikes landed showed a greater probability of winning.

Takedown Efficiency: Efficient takedown rates are correlated with higher win percentages.

Venue Impact: Certain venues affected the fight outcomes due to factors like altitude or crowd influence.

Predictive Accuracy: Logistic regression models achieved significant predictive accuracy, suggesting that data-driven strategies could be utilized to anticipate fight outcomes.

## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into predictive modeling for UFC fights. The analysis provides significant evidence for the importance of striking and takedown statistics in determining fight winners. Future analyses could explore advanced machine learning models or include additional features to further refine predictions.
