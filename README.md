Predictive-Modeling-UFC-Fights

## Project Overview

This project uses comprehensive data from the UFC to predict fight outcomes and evaluate various influencing factors. The dataset includes statistics such as strikes landed, takedowns, fight venue, and much more. By building predictive models and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project aims to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that could help in forecasting the outcomes of future UFC matches.

The Dataset is from 2010 - 2020

166 Events occurred during this time frame. This dataset reflects this as well. 

This time range goes from 3/21/2010 to 3/14/2020 (this is when CODID-19 began)

Fights before 2010 are being valued with less importance as fighters fighting prior to 2010 shnould not be fighting at high levels. 

## Objectives

Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict the outcomes of UFC fights.

Exploratory Analysis: Identify key statistics and patterns that influence fight outcomes.

Statistical Insights: Understand how different factors like venue, strikes, and takedowns impact the fight results.

## Data Sources

Data Contains comprehensive statistics for UFC fights, with each row representing a specific match. Statistics include strikes landed, takedowns, fighter attributes, and more.
Two different datasets put together to come up with merged dataset with dates of March 2010 to April 2020.

## Methodology

## Data Preparation:

Cleaned and standardized the data to ensure consistent statistical analysis.

Engineered new features from existing columns to enhance model predictability.
